In this project I implemented a research paper on Joint Solution for PET Image Segmentation and Denoising on ITK.
First, Generalized Anscombe Transformation (GAT) is used for Guassianizing the multiplicative noise in the PET images. Then segmentation is performed on the Generalised Anscombe Transformed PET images by affinity propogation based clustering algorithm.
At the end of the segmentation process, Inverse GAT is performed on the segmented PET images to achieve denoising.
