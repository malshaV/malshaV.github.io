### IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) Student Branch Chapter, University of Moratuwa
<br>
[IEEE EMBS](https://www.embs.org/) is the largest international society of biomedical engineers. IEEE EMBS Student Branch Chapter ([IEEE EMBS at UoM](https://site.ieee.org/sb-moratuwa-embs/)) is the affiliated student body at the University of Moratuwa which works in collaboration with the Bio Medical specialization in the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.
Being the inaugural and the only IEEE EMBS Student Branch Chapter to operate within Sri Lanka, the chapter has contributed in creating awareness about biomedical engineering and promoting solutions to healthcare problems in Sri Lanka.
