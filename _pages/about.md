<!-- I graduated with a BSc in Biomedical Engineering from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/) and I am currently working as a Lecturer on Contract at the Dept. of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering ([ENTC](http://ent.mrt.ac.lk/web3/)), University of Moratuwa. -->

I am currently in my 4th year of pursuing a Ph.D. under the supervision of [Dr. Vishal Patel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkEXTbIAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Vision and Image Understanding (VIU) Lab in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. My research encompasses the realms of computer vision and deep learning, primarily concentrating on investigating and mitigating data memorization issues, as well as addressing fairness and bias in generative models and vision-language models (VLMs). I am also interested in applying deep generative models to low-level vision tasks, particularly in image restoration.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), Sri Lanka in 2020, where I completed my thesis on designing a sEMG sensor system for controlling a bionic hand, advised by [Dr. Simon Kappel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFY3fsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I worked as a Research Assistant at  Agency for Science Technology and Research ([A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/)), Singapore under the supervision of Dr.[Bhanu Prakash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZQ3VF_gAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Shigeki Sugii](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=13LIAvAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). 

<!-- There, I worked on cell classification in fluorescent microscopy images based analytical system to automatically identify the
browning of adipocytes and  implementing a deep learning framework for brain hemorrhage segmentation in CT images. -->
