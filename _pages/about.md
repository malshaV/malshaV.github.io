<!-- I graduated with a BSc in Biomedical Engineering from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/) and I am currently working as a Lecturer on Contract at the Dept. of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering ([ENTC](http://ent.mrt.ac.lk/web3/)), University of Moratuwa. -->

I am currently in my third year of pursuing a Ph.D. under the supervision of [Dr. Vishal Patel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkEXTbIAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Vision and Image Understanding (VIU) Lab in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. My research encompasses the realms of computer vision and deep learning, primarily concentrating on the application of deep generative models to low-level vision applications, especially in the domain of image restoration. Additionally, I am passionately involved in exploring challenges related to data memorization and devising solutions for fairness and bias issues within deep generative models.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from [University of Moratuwa](https://uom.lk/), Sri Lanka in 2020, where I completed my thesis on designing a sEMG sensor system for controlling a bionic hand, advised by [Dr. Simon Kappel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFY3fsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I worked as a Research Assistant at  Agency for Science Technology and Research ([A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/)), Singapore under the supervision of Dr.[Bhanu Prakash](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZQ3VF_gAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Shigeki Sugii](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&user=13LIAvAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). 

<!-- There, I worked on cell classification in fluorescent microscopy images based analytical system to automatically identify the
browning of adipocytes and  implementing a deep learning framework for brain hemorrhage segmentation in CT images. -->
